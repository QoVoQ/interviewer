1. On Performance (Inspired by PayPal & Starstruck experience): "Your resume mentions you improved data transfer performance by 45% at Starstruck using AWS ElastiCache. On the frontend, how would you diagnose a slow-rendering page? Walk me through the tools you'd use (e.g., Chrome DevTools), the key metrics you'd look for (FCP, LCP, TBT), and what specific frontend optimizations you might implement."

2. On JavaScript & React (Inspired by multiple React projects): "In your Upskilling Recommendation AI project, you used React. Could you explain the difference between useMemo and useCallback? More importantly, describe a scenario where using them would be necessary for performance, and a scenario where their usage would be superfluous or even harmful."

-- 3. On State Management (Inspired by the Concert Booking & Employee Gamification projects): "For a complex application like the concert booking app, how did you approach state management? When would you choose to use React's built-in useState/useReducer versus a global state library like Redux or Zustand? What are the trade-offs?"

4. On the Microservices Sandbox Project: "You used Kong Gateway to secure endpoints. From a frontend perspective, how do you handle authentication and authorization? Walk me through how you would manage a user's JWT token securely—from login, storing it, attaching it to API requests, and handling token expiration."

What I'm looking for: Security awareness, understanding of token-based auth flow, and knowledge of secure storage (httpOnly cookies vs. localStorage).

5. On the WFH Booking Site Project: "You mentioned achieving 80% code coverage. That's a great metric. What, in your opinion, are the pitfalls of focusing solely on code coverage? How do you write meaningful tests for a React component? Give me an example of a test you wrote that caught a bug or prevented a regression."
