Hi [Candidate Name], I'm [Your Name], a Frontend Developer from the Data Infra team at Shopee. It’s great to meet you, and thank you for taking the time to speak with us today.

Just to give you an idea of what to expect: we’ve set aside about 60 minutes for this interview. We’ll start by talking about your experience, then move into some technical concepts, and finally, we’ll work through a couple of coding exercises together.

How does that sound?
